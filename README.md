# SQL-like
 * [Esper](http://www.espertech.com/esper/) Complex Event Processing (CEP) and event series analysis are used for detecting situations among events. EsperTech provides the Event Processing Language (EPL) designed for concisely expressing situations and fast execution against both historical and currently-arriving events.
 * [WSO2 CEP](http://wso2.com/products/complex-event-processor/) Data to insight in a flash, routine business operations – a flight landed, a credit card processed, a package shipped – generate a constant high volume, stream of events. In a fast changing and competitive business climate identifying meaningful patterns from large sets of incoming data events, from multiple sources in real time, helps to become a more agile connected business. It allows you to anticipate risks or flag opportunities in real time, thereby responding to urgent business situations with both speed and precision.
 * [Oracle Stream Explorer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/complex-event-processing/overview/index.html) The Oracle Stream Explorer platform provides a compelling combination of an easy-to-use visual façade to rapidly create and dynamically change Real Time Event Stream Processing (Fast Data) applications, together with a comprehensive run-time platform to manage and execute these solutions. 

# Rule-based

 * [Informatcia RulePoint Complex Event Processing](https://www.informatica.com/products/data-integration/real-time-integration/rulepoint-complex-event-processing.html) RulePoint complex event processing software provides proactive monitoring and operational intelligence by delivering real-time alerts and insight into pertinent information, enabling you to operate smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more competitively. Its real-time alerts are based on sets of conditions defined by business users.
 * [Apama](http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/apama_webmethods/analytics/overview/default.asp) Software AG's Apama Streaming Analytics—supporting predictive analytics— is the world’s #1 platform for streaming analytics and intelligent automated action on fast-moving big data. Combining event processing, messaging, in-memory data management and visualization, this platform is the most complete solution to turn relentless data streams—like those produced by the Internet of Things (IoT)—into meaningful real-time metrics.

# Graphical
 * [StreamBase](http://www.streambase.com/) The TIBCO StreamBase® Complex Event Processing (CEP) platform is a high-performance system for rapidly building applications that analyze and act on real-time streaming data. Using StreamBase CEP, you can rapidly build real-time systems and deploy them at a fraction of the cost and risk of other alternatives
 * [striim](http://www.striim.com/) Striim uniquely combines both streaming data integration and streaming operational intelligence in a single platform.
